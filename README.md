# RPiZero2_EI_Examples
Examples that work on the Raspberry Pi 2 Zero with Edge Impulse 
These are working running on DietPi v9.9.0 with edge-impulse-linux 1.0.10, installed as per the instructions at https://github.com/edgeimpulse/linux-sdk-python
This takes the classify-image.py example and expands it to work with the Raspberry Pi camera and print circles to indicate the positions given by the FOFO model.
